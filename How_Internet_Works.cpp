//* How internet works -> 
//? Definition -> GLobal system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet Protocol Suite(TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices.
//* Internet -> Interconnected networks of computer around the world 

//? Router -> each computer on a network is connected to a special tiny computer called a router. This router has only one job: like a signaler at a railway station, it makes sure that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer.
//* To send a message to computer B, computer A must send the message to the router, which in turn forwards the message to computer B and makes sure the message is not delivered to computer C.

//? Modem -> To connect our network to the telephone infrastructure, we need a special piece of equipment called a modem. This modem turns the information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.

//? Whenever we search any URL in chrome then your browser will find that URL in DNS (about the IP address of the given link) and DNS is just like a phonebook where we get all the URL's -> IP's and jaise hi ye IP address mill jaayega then appka browser uss web server tak ek connection banaayega, aur jaise hi uss server se kuch response aata hai toh matlab hum connected hai 

//* Lekin jab bhi hum kisi website se kuch request krrte hai toh uske liye ek set of rules ko apne ko follow krrna padta hai (TCP/IP -> Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) 
//? Har ek request jo ki apna browser ek server tak bhejta hai uska jo response hai woh chhote chhote tukdo mein chop hoke hamaare paas aa raha hota hai, woh ek single form mein kabhi nahi hoga, ek baar jab pura data collect ho jaata hai toh woh hamaare computer mein re-assemble hokrr dikhne lag jaata hai
