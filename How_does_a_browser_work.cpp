//todo -- How does a web browser works...??? 
//? A browser is a s/w application used to locate, retrieve and display content on the WORLD WIDE WEB, including Web pages, images, video and other files. 
//* A browser is a group of structured codes which together performs a series of tasks to display a web page on the screen.


//! Hign level architecture of browser -> 
//? 1. The User Interface -> the user interface is the space where User interacts with the browser. 

//* 2. The Browser Engine -> the browser engine works as a bridge between the UI and the rendering engine. Basically it manipualates the rendering engine (basically ye UI se action lekrr, rendering part ko command deta hai)

//? 3. The Rendering Engine -> This is the core part of the browser that turns raw data(like HTML, CSS, and JS) into a visual webpage. It reads the HTML code, applies the CSS styles, runs JS, and arranges everything into what you see on the screen. 

//* 4. Networking -> The networking component handles all the communication between your browser and the internet. 
    //? Basically it sends the HTTP request to servers(when you visit a website)
    //* Receiving the responses
    //? Managing connections to different websites via protocols like HTTP or HTTPS

    //* It's main aim is to ensure that the data is transferred properly over the internet

//? 5. Javascript Engine -> It is that part of browser that is responsible for running the JS code on the webpage. JS is what makes your webpage interactive 


//* 6. Data Storage -> The Data Storage component stores data locally on your device, so website things about you (like login information)
    //? Cookies : Small piece of data stored by the websites 
    //* Local Storage : Larger amounts of data that websites can store (like settings or user preferences)
    //? Cache : Temporary storage of website files to make future visit faster 


//? 7. UI Backend -> is responsible for drawing the UI and handling the things like screen rendering and managing interactions
//* Basically it displays everything on the screen 


//* 8. Security -> keeps you safe



Each part works together to make sure you can visit websites, interact with them, and stay secure while browsing.
